# Claude
I'm bad news. I'll always remember my mama, she'd say "Claude... you're bad news, boy". When I was 17 I went to see this voodoo lady at the fair, just for a lark. She looked at my pawm for no more than 3 seconds and shreeked. She threw orange peals and muttered hexes at me.

Some people got bad Hoodoo some people got good Hoodoo. I got both.
I lived a good life before the bombs dropped. I worked a boring data entry job that payed well, I had a beautiful wife. I had my very own basement vault. Rare luxury. 
On the day the bombs dropped I rushed home to find the vault door locked. Turns out my wife was a КГБ undercover agent. See thought I must be handling top secret govornment communications. Why else would they pay me large sums of money to play snake on a computer all day. 
When the bombs dropped the house completely collapsed. The bunker never stood a chance. Katya was crushed inside. I however, deciding I shan't go in to the cold night hungry, was in the kitchen, making a sandwitch. The explosion knocked over the stainless steel refrigirator and it collapsed on top of me. It ended up shielding me from most of the debris. Didn't do much about the radiation. You live by the Hoodoo and you become a grotesque monster by the Hoodoo

Good Hoodoo: Find the possible location of a geniune PIP-Boy
Bad Hoodoo: Tuns out the local snatchers were just leading me to a trap.
Good Hoodoo: I scored big at the casino and finally afforded that sweet 6-shooter I've had my eye on AND had enough left over for my first harmonica
Bad Hoodoo: The snatchers stole that along with my clothes and everything else
Bad Hoodoo: They tied me up, threw me in to a coffin and threw the coffin down the river
Good Hoodoo: They're dumb enough to not realize that wood floats

Wonder where I'll end up?
